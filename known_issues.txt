Only one director is found (some movies have 2+ directors...)
If numerous movies share a title it might find the wrong one

Issues
Check all times and dates and then I think we're good

Fixed! Date detector doesn't work with dates that have two dots
   in them (Priscilla, Idaho...)
Fixed! Doesn't recognise date ranges with ~
  Eg 10月25日(水) ～ 10月28日(土)
  10月29日(日) ～ 10月31日(火)
Fixed! Doesn't seem to handle dots as expected - dates are
   included that shouldn't be (Petra Von Kant, Von Braun...)
Fixed! Wrong time pulled on ヴァチカン - seems to be the end time
